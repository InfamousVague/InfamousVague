Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer with deep roots in JavaScript, having worked with the language for over a decade across frontend, backend, and tooling. Over the years Iâ€™ve built everything from lightweight developer utilities to large, distributed applications designed for production use. My experience spans the entire lifecycle â€” prototyping, architecting modular systems, shipping reliable code, and maintaining complex projects with active user communities.
Much of my open-source work centers on building decentralized and developer-facing tools:



Across all of these projects, the throughline is my ability to design and deliver high-impact JavaScript code: modern frontend frameworks (Svelte, Nuxt, React), backend services, package managers, and real-time systems. Iâ€™ve worked in TypeScript extensively, and Iâ€™m equally comfortable bridging into Rust, Solidity, or C# when a project demands it.
