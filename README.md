Iâ€™ve been building things with JavaScript for years, long enough to see it go from powering tiny browser scripts to being the backbone of full platforms. Itâ€™s the language I know best, but Iâ€™ve also picked up Rust, Solidity, and C# along the way when projects needed something faster, safer, or just different. What I enjoy most is taking an idea that feels almost impossible and breaking it down until itâ€™s something real that people can actually use.

### Featured Projects

- [**Uplink**](https://github.com/Satellite-im/Uplink) - A secure, peer-to-peer chat client built on Rust, IPFS, and LibP2P. I helped shape how messages and peers flow through the system, making sure it stays private and reliable at scale. Itâ€™s been starred and forked by other developers, which is always a good sign that the work is useful beyond my own circle.  

- [**UplinkWeb**](https://github.com/Satellite-im/UplinkWeb) - The browser side of Uplink, written in Svelte and TypeScript. I focused on real-time updates and performance here, making sure the frontend could keep up with the distributed backend without feeling clunky.  

- [**RetrosGenerators**](https://github.com/InfamousVague/RetrosGenerators) - A plugin for Minecraft that lets players build custom generator blocks for mini-games. Itâ€™s a smaller project, but itâ€™s been picked up by others in the community and continues to get downloads long after I wrote it.  


I like working on projects that matter! Whether thatâ€™s a big system with lots of moving parts or a smaller tool that makes life easier for other developers.
